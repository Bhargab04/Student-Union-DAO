Vision
The Student Union DAO aims to create a decentralized platform that empowers students to manage their own affairs. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform enables transparent proposal creation, voting, and execution, fostering a more democratic and participatory environment within student unions.

Suggest Ideas: A feature that allows members to create and submit proposals for new ideas, events, or changes within the union.
Discussion Forum:

Talk About Proposals: A space where members can discuss and debate proposals before voting, helping everyone understand the ideas better.
Voting Mechanism:

Token-Based Voting: A system where members can vote on proposals using digital tokens, making the decision-making process inclusive and fair.
Smart Contracts:

Automatic Execution: Use of smart contracts to automatically carry out approved proposals, such as organizing an event or reallocating funds, without the need for manual intervention.
Blockchain Recording:

Secure Record-Keeping: All proposals, votes, and actions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that the entire process is transparent and tamper-proof.
Proposal Tracking:

Follow Progress: A feature that lets members track the status of proposals, from submission to discussion, voting, and execution.
Resource Management Dashboard:

Manage Funds and Resources: A dashboard that shows how funds and resources are being allocated and used, helping ensure they are managed efficiently.
Global Collaboration Tools:

Connect with Others: Tools that allow students from different institutions and regions to collaborate, share ideas, and work together on proposals.
Educational Modules:

Learn While Participating: Built-in resources and tutorials to help students learn about blockchain technology, decentralized systems, and how to effectively participate in the DAO.

Contract Address
Note: The contract has not been deployed yet. You will need to deploy this smart contract to an Ethereum network to get an address. For testing, you can deploy it to a testnet like Rinkeby or Ropsten.(need to be done)

# Future Scope
Advanced Proposal Features:

Introduce support for different types of proposals, such as budget requests, policy changes, and event planning.
Implement a tiered approval process based on the nature of the proposal.
Role-Based Access Control:

Develop role-based permissions to define different levels of authority within the DAO, such as committee members, treasurers, or event coordinators.
Create a voting system with weighted votes for different roles.
Funding Mechanism:

Integrate funding mechanisms such as donations, membership fees, or a treasury fund to support proposal execution.
Implement financial tracking and reporting features.
Enhanced Security Measures:

Conduct thorough security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Implement additional security features such as multi-signature approvals or time locks for critical actions.
User Interface Development:

Develop a web or mobile application to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the DAO.
Include features like proposal submission forms, voting dashboards, and notifications.
Community Engagement:

Create educational resources and workshops to onboard new members and help them understand the DAOâ€™s functionality.
Develop engagement strategies to foster active participation and feedback.
