Vision
The Student Union DAO aims to create a decentralized platform that empowers students to manage their own affairs. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform enables transparent proposal creation, voting, and execution, fostering a more democratic and participatory environment within student unions.

Contract Address
Note: The contract has not been deployed yet. You will need to deploy this smart contract to an Ethereum network to get an address. For testing, you can deploy it to a testnet like Rinkeby or Ropsten.

Future Scope
Advanced Proposal Features: Integrate features such as different proposal types (e.g., fund requests, policy changes).
Role-Based Access: Introduce different roles and permissions within the DAO (e.g., committee members).
Funding Mechanism: Implement mechanisms for funding proposals through donations or budget allocations.
Enhanced Security: Conduct extensive security audits and add additional safeguards against potential vulnerabilities.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly web or mobile interface for easier interaction with the DAO.
