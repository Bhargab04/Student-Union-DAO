Counter Smart Contract
Overview
The Counter Smart Contract is a basic example of a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It features simple functionalities to increment a counter and retrieve its current value. This contract is ideal for demonstrating fundamental concepts in smart contract development, including state variables, functions, and events.

Features
Increment Counter: Allows users to increase the counter value by 1.
Retrieve Counter Value: Provides the current value of the counter.
Event Logging: Emits an event each time the counter is incremented.
Contract Code

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract Counter {
    uint private counter;

    event CounterIncremented(uint newCounterValue);

    constructor() {
        counter = 0;
    }

    function increment() public {
        counter++;
        emit CounterIncremented(counter);
    }

    function getCounter() public view returns (uint) {
        return counter;
    }
}
Explanation
State Variable: uint private counter; - Stores the current counter value.
Event: CounterIncremented(uint newCounterValue); - Logs the new counter value after each increment.
Constructor: Initializes the counter to 0 upon deployment.
Function increment(): Increases the counter value and emits an event.
Function getCounter(): Returns the current counter value.
Deployment
Using Remix:

Go to Remix IDE.
Copy and paste the contract code into a new file.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract using the Remix interface.
Using Truffle:

Install Truffle globally with npm install -g truffle.
Create a new Truffle project with truffle init.
Save the contract code in the contracts directory.
Compile and deploy using truffle compile and truffle migrate.
Using Hardhat:

Install Hardhat with npm install --save-dev hardhat.
Create a new Hardhat project with npx hardhat.
Save the contract code in the contracts directory.
Compile and deploy using npx hardhat compile and npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js.
Usage
Increment the Counter:

Call the increment() function to increase the counter value by 1. This function also emits the CounterIncremented event.
Retrieve the Counter Value:

Call the getCounter() function to obtain the current value of the counter.
Testing
To ensure the contract behaves as expected:

Write Unit Tests: Create unit tests in the test directory using a testing framework like Mocha or Chai.
Run Tests: Execute tests using Truffle or Hardhat to validate contract functionality.
